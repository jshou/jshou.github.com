      Josh Hou is an accordionist based in Seattle. He started on piano but picked up the accordion in 2013 and has been making music with it ever since. His projects include: instrumental Chinese jazz, How Short - a swing band with vocal harmonies, and Jazztalk Seattle - a Seattle area jazz podcast.

      The Horn Bellows is his latest record, recorded and mixed with long-time collaborator and friend, Ray Larsen. Listen to it [here](https://joshandray.bandcamp.com/)! For press, the link to the EPK is [here](https://music.joshuahou.com/hornbellows_epk.pdf).
