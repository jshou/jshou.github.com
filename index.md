      Josh Hou is an accordionist, pianist, composer, and arranger based in Seattle. Having grown up in three countries (United States, China, Malaysia), his work reflects the multicultural sonorities of his upbringing and heritage, both in music and language. He has two records out as a solo bandleader: <em>Feeling of Home</em> (2020) and <em>Bilingualism</em> (2019).

      His latest project is <em>The Horn Bellows</em> (2022), recorded and mixed with long-time collaborator and friend, Ray Larsen. Listen to it [here](https://joshandray.bandcamp.com/)! For press, the link to the EPK is [here](https://music.joshuahou.com/hornbellows_epk.pdf).

      Josh, along with collaborator Max Holmberg, produced and hosted <em>Jazztalk Seattle</em>, a now discontinued monthly Seattle area jazz podcast that lasted for five years. He also continues to sing and play in <em>How Short</em>, a swing band co-led with guitarist Andy Short.
